                    <p>S. Nambi Narayanan (born 12 December 1941) is an Indian scientist and an
                        aerospace engineer. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award by the
                        Government of India. The scientist was instrumental in developing the Vikas engine that would be
                        used for the first PSLV that India launched. As a senior official at the Indian Space Research
                        Organisation (ISRO), he was in-charge of the cryogenics division. In 1994, he was falsely
                        charged
                        with espionage and arrested. The charges against him were dismissed by the Central Bureau of
                        Investigation (CBI) in April 1996, and the Supreme Court of India declared him not guilty in
                        1998.

                <li>
                    <h3>Early life:</h3>
                    <p>S. Nambi Narayanan was born into a middle-class Tamil family on 12 December 1941 in Nagercoil,
                        Travancore, which is in present-day Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu, where he also completed
                        his schooling at DVD Higher Secondary School....</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p>Narayanan first met Vikram Sarabhai, the then Chairman of ISRO, in 1966 at the Thumba Equatorial
                        Rocket Launching Station in Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram, while he worked as a payload integrator
                        with another eminent scientist Y. S. Rajan there. Also chairman of the Space Science and
                        technology Centre (SSTC) at the time, Sarabhai only recruited highly qualified professionals. In
                        pursuit, Narayanan enrolled at the College of Engineering in Thiruvananthapuram for his MTech
                        degree.....</p>
                    <h4>Espionage charges</h4>
                    <p>In 1994, Narayanan was charged with leaking vital defence secrets to two alleged Maldivian
                        intelligence officers, Mariam Rasheeda and Fauzia Hassan. Defense officials said the secrets
                        pertained to highly confidential "flight test data" from experiments with rocket and satellite
                        launches. Narayanan was among two scientists (the other being D. Sasikumaran) that were accused
                        of selling the secrets for millions. However, his house seemed nothing out of the ordinary and
                        did not show signs of the corrupt gains he was accused of.</p>
